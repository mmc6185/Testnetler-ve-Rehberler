### I created this guide so that you can easily install it with the help of a script.

### The passwords you use during installation must be 8 characters. 

### All passwords that you created during installation must be the same.

### Run this script to start the installation

```
wget -O nulink-en.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brsbrc/Testnetler-ve-Rehberler/main/NuLink/nulink-en.sh && chmod +x nulink-en.sh && ./nulink-en.sh
```

## You will create a password in this section.

## The public address of the key and the Path to the secret key file make a note of this information somewhere, it is important.

## In the Confirm seed words section, we write the words that were just written in blue

### if you see an output like the following when you check the log, this is not a problem. The reason for this; This is because the worker would send a confirm transaction to blockchain. It will automatically calculate the gas price using web3 library. And the price is too low so the transaction pool do not handling this transaction.
